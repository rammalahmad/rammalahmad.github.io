Hello! I'm Ahmad, a dedicated individual with a profound enthusiasm for mathematics, AI, and entrepreneurship. With a background in AI research from [Ecole polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), I enjoy addressing challenging problems in the field of AI. Beyond academics, you can find me pursuing my hobbies, which include climbing, calisthenics, playing the guitar, and reading.

I'm excited to share that our latest research paper, titled "Correlated Quantization for Faster Nonconvex Distributed
Optimization" is now available on arXiv. This work was conducted during my internship at [KAUST](https://kaust.edu.sa) in the group of [Peter Richtarik](https://richtarik.org), in collaboration with [Yury Demidovich](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CDENSiUAAAAJ&hl=ru), and Andrei Panferov.

**Paper Overview**
In this paper we focus on the use of correlated quantizers, introduced by Suresh et al. in 2022, and demonstrate how these quantizers offer benefits over traditional independent quantizers in terms of communication complexity. The paper's primary contribution is the analysis and improvement of the MARINA algorithm, a leading distributed non-convex optimization method. By incorporating correlated quantizers, we show that their enhanced version of MARINA outperforms both the original MARINA and the distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method of Suresh et al. in terms of communication efficiency.
This expansion significantly broadens the usability of the MARINA algorithm beyond the conventional setup, which typically involves independent and unbiased compressors. The paper also presents extensive experimental results that support our theoretical claims.

**Paper Overview**
In our recent paper, we focus on Byzantine-robust learning with compression, a crucial element for distributed optimization in collaborative learning scenarios. We introduce Byz-DASHA-PAGE, a novel Byzantine-robust method with compression, which offers superior convergence rates, smaller neighborhood sizes in heterogeneous cases, and increased tolerance to Byzantine workers compared to the state-of-the-art Byz-VR-MARINA. Additionally, we present Byz-EF21, the first Byzantine-robust method with communication compression and error feedback.
